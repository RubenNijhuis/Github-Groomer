# Github Groomer
ðŸ’ˆ A chrome extension to make github seem a bit cleaner. Let's remove those distasteful borders and get some modern design in here.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repo to an easy to access folder
$ git clone https://github.com/RubenNijhuis/Github-Groomer.git
```
After cloning open the url `chrome://extensions` and switch to `Developer Mode`
Click on  `Load unpacked` and choose the Github Groomer package.

If you don't see any change on your github check to see if the extension is turned on by going to the extensions page.

Enjoy a groomed github :)
